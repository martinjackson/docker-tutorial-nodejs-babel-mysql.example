# docker-tutorial-nodejs-babel-mysql.example

This came from Docker-Desktop tutorial

The 2 minute tutorial has you spin up and run your first container (docker-container docker1010tutorial)
With this container running you can then browse to the container

http://localhost:8080/tutorial/our-application/

This gives you a more in depth example of tasking a working project and placing it into a container.
